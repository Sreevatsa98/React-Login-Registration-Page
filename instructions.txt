To run the project 

npm start 

Login page credentials

Email: test@gmail.com   
Password: test@123

Registration Form 
=> Fill in all the details and it will get submitted into an Google Spreadsheet 
=> To see that go to App.js
=> Comment this line --- "currentForm === 'login' ? <Login onFormSwitch={toggleForm} /> : <Registration onFormSwitch={toggleForm}/>"
=> Uncommet --- "<UserData />" and reload the page it will display all the record in the table format

# All the changed is been Commited through "Git" #

Validation had to be removed since there was some error in uploading the file to Google Spreadsheet 

My apologies I couldn't implement insertion, deletion and update with sorting and filtering due to short of time

Hope you consider it 

Thank you
